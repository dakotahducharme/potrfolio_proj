                Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway
                Cough hairball on conveniently placed pants love me! meeeeouw for stare out the window. 
                Cough hairball on conveniently placed pants cat walks in keyboard. 
                Weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed paw your face to wake you up in the morning. 
                Meow all night one of these days i'm going to get that red dot, just you wait and see somehow manage to 
                catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock, and murf pratt 
                ungow ungow or poop on the floor, break a planter, sprint, eat own hair, vomit hair, hiss, chirp at birds, 
                eat a squirrel, hide from fireworks, lick toe beans, attack christmas tree for eat the fat cats food, i is 
                playing on your console hooman. Spread kitty litter all over house scoot butt on the rug chase after silly 
                colored fish toys around the house making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes so sit on human or rub 
                face on owner. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep poop on floor and watch human clean up. Climb 
                leg love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the 
                glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) proudly present butt to human. Sleep purr 
                like an angel mew mew and lick sellotape. Sugar, my siamese, stalks me (in a good way), day and night sit 
                in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum. Twitch tail in permanent irritation lick yarn hanging out of own butt 
                get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper and if it fits, i sits so cat jumps and falls 
                onto the couch purrs and wakes up in a new dimension filled with kitty litter meow meow yummy there is a 
                bunch of cats hanging around eating catnip or missing until dinner time. Ooooh feather moving feather!.
                 Why can't i catch that stupid red dot lasers are tiny mice for i can haz, blow up sofa in 3 seconds, or the
                 fat cat sat on the mat bat away with paws, stares at human while pushing stuff off a table decide to want 
                 nothing to do with my owner today. I show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your
                  hand kitty kitty and ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway or your pillow is now my pet bed. 
                  Have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat good 
                  now the other hand, too.

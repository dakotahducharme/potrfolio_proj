            <h3>Hi, I'm Dakotah üëã</h3>
            <p>
               I'm a software engineer currently based out of Phoenix, Arizona. I'm a team player with a passion for design,
               sustainability, and accessibility. In addition to software, I'm a big fan of vegan food, cute animals, 
               video games, and classic literature. I love to learn new skills, and take on new challenges. I'll
               definitely be guilty of trying to talk your ear off about my latest javascript project, or my current favorite metal album.

            <p>
               My name is Dakotah, and I'm a software engineer who's passionate about all things tech. While that may sound like a cliche
               I mean it genuinely! I began my engineering journey in high school, where I co-founded a 
               drone program with my friends. When we competed in drone competitions, we knew we could score extra points if we programmed
               the drones to fly autonomously. After realizing how satisfying it was to create and run scripts, I continued my education
               in San Francisco, where I attended General Assmebly and received my certifcation in web development.</br></br></br>
               In my spare time, I enjoy handmaking rugs, bothering my cat, and attending concerts. If you really want to get on my good side,
               try talking to me about houseplants or video games.
